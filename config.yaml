# Critical: input files for HSDSnake, please only substitute the species name to yours, keep the input file format, such as Athaliana.interproscan.tsv, Athaliana.ko.txt


names:
  - Athaliana
  - Creinhardtii

# Warning! Make sure your species name above without '.', '_', for example don't use Arabidopisis_thalina or A.thalina or A.thalina_sp
# if you really want to diff the strains from same speceis. Do it like Athaliana-sp1, Athaliana-sp2 etc.
# This is because DupGeneFinder capture species name using . and _ as delimiter. I don't have an easy fix to allow more flexibility.
